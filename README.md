# CNNs and Transfer Learning

Welcome to the "CNNs and Transfer Learning" repository! This project is part of the coursework at the University de Toulon, conducted under the guidance of Professor R. Marxer Pau. Here, we explore the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning using PyTorch.

## Introduction

In our previous lab, we utilized the high-level API of PyTorch to implement a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). We observed that shifted images resulted in significantly worse classification results, even though they remained visually recognizable to the human eye.

In this lab, we aim to enhance the translation invariance of images by incorporating convolutional layers into our models. Our objectives include:

- Implementing a convolutional model in PyTorch for image classification on the MNIST dataset.
- Leveraging the torch CUDA device for improved training performance.
- Exploring and applying transfer learning techniques using pretrained models.

## Objectives

### Key Objectives

1. **CNN Implementation**: Learn to create a simple CNN model in PyTorch to perform image classification.

2. **CUDA for Improved Performance**: Utilize the torch CUDA device to accelerate training and enhance performance.

3. **Transfer Learning**: Understand the concept of transfer learning and apply it to a new dataset of fish images using pretrained models.
